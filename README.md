# Editor CMS

This will be my first "medium-sized" project. A CMS for blogs built with nextjs and editorjs

## Update
I decided to switch from Editorjs and a seperate CMS to TinaCMS and a build-in CMS. I started a [new project](https://github.com/Jak-Ch-ll/nextjs_tinaCMS) and am putting this one on pause for the moment. I still learned quite a lot in the process of working with editorjs.

## Goals and challenges
* An easy-to-use custom CMS
* An API to access the database from other programs
* User authentification

## Planned technology and reasons
* [Editorjs](https://editorjs.io/)
  * I really do like the style and it seems to be easily 
* [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/)
  * No real reason, I just wanna use next more in the future, so I thought why not start now
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
  * My frontend framework of choice at the moment
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
  * My database of choice at the moment
* [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)
  * During testing a tried a few orms but got stuck with this one
  * Quite easy to use after a bit of setup
